## Set up
1. Get a bot token and invite it to your server.
A bot token should look like this `ODgyODM3MDU0NDk1NTM1MTQ0.YTBMFA.tHQg10UAgQ7NtzHpFKVnoXMhfHY`
2. Go to `cogs/level.json` and add your levels to it.
3. Run `main.py` and your bot should work (Install requirements first, you should know how so don't ask)
4. Make sure to add credit or meet my lawsuit >:)
